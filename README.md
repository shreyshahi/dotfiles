# dotfiles

After years of losing old config files decided to finally track them in git. This repo is just a record of my config files, so that I can easily move them when I switch computers again. To use these files just clone the repo and create a symlink to point the dotfile to the corresponding file in this repo.

## Vim

I am using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage my vim plugins. Follow the directions in vim-plug's readme file to install the plugin manager, and then run `:PlugInstall` to install all the plugins.
